I am a lover of technology. I am a problem solver no matter the complexity of the problem. I have a deep interest of the ins and outs of computers and tech in general.

## Objective


I am on a long journey of learning cybersecurity and will stay on that road. I am excited to learn, always. I am currently aiming for an entry level IT/help desk career, later aiming on to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 analyst and to move up from there.
